# Neural-network-Recognizing-Latin-Alphabet-Based-on-Hand-gesture-and-Real-Time-Camera-Testing

Implementation of a neural network for recognizing Latin alphabet based on movement of the human hand. Our project aims to build a powerful tool for recognizing handwritten text that can be used in various applications such as handwriting recognition and gesture-based interfaces.

The repository contains the code for training a neural network using the Latin alphabet dataset. The neural network has been designed specifically to recognize the patterns of hand gesture associated with Latin letters, enabling it to accurately classify different letters based on their gesture.

In addition to the training code, this repository also contains a feature for testing the performance of the model using a camera. After training the model, users can turn on their camera and feed images of their hand to the neural network for classification. This feature enables users to directly test the performance of the trained model in real-time.

This implementation is ideal for those interested in machine learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition, and provides valuable insights into how to train a neural network from scratch and apply it to real-world problems.

So, come and explore the code, learn how to train your own neural network for recognizing Latin letters using hand movements, and test its performance by feeding images from your camera.
